# CIFAR100-ImageClassification
This repository contains an image classification project using the CIFAR-100 dataset to explore and compare three image classification approaches:
1. Hand-Crafted Features
2. Neural Networks (NN)
3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project was part of my MSc in Artificial Intelligence and demonstrates skills in computer vision, model development, and performance evaluation.

## Dataset Overview
The CIFAR-100 dataset consists of:
- 100 Classes: Each with 600 images (500 training, 100 testing).
- 20 Superclasses: Classes grouped into broader categories.
- Fine Labels: Specific class labels.
- Coarse Labels: Grouped superclass labels.
For this project, 15 classes were selected to build and train the models. 

## Outcomes
- Demonstrates a variety of computer vision techniques, from traditional to modern deep learning approaches.
- Highlights the progression from hand-crafted feature methods to advanced neural network-based solutions.
- Provides a clear comparison of the strengths and limitations of each approach on the same dataset.

## 1. Hand-Crafted Features Approach
